### What Is This?

This is the beginnings of a new implementation of a firefighting game based on Shawn Betts’s wildfire,
this new implementation being primarily written in Lisp. The game play of this new version will be
significantly different, being largely mouse driven rather than keystroke.

As of 8 September 2023 this remains just the beginnings of this new implementation, and it’s
certainly no where near being ready to play or demonstrate. But we’ll get there eventually,
and when we do this README will become a bit more useful.
